# This playbook's function is to update the git clones for all
# git repositories use by the OpenStack-Ansible integrated build.
#
# The playbook intentionally clones the full repository to ensure
# that it's usable by all RPC releases, regardless of branch.
#
# The playbook also intentionally uses the OSA master branch as it
# is expected to contain more repositories than RPC will need, but
# will always have a complete set.
