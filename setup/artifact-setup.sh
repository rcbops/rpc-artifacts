# out at /opt/rpc-openstack, so we need to make sure that
# it is there. The folder the script may be run from could
# be another folder (as it is in jenkins), so we check
# whether the folder has 'rpc-openstack' in the name. If it
# does, we symlink it. If not, then we clone and replace
# the artifacts-building submodule with the current working
# directory. This enables testing using the artifacts repo
# on its own.
